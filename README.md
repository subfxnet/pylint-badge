# pybadge 

pylint badges for everyone!

## Howto

1. Install via `pip` or other method.
2. Run as follows: `pylint-badge script.py` which will produce a file `pylint.svg` in the current directory. 


## Idea
Inspired by mperlet's [pybadge](https://github.com/mperlet/pybadge), which was in turn inspired by [this blogpost](http://www.desmondrivet.com/blog/technical/pylint-badges.html.)
